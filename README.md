# maviethin - the average chess engine

I'm making this chess engine in C to get some hands-on experience with it.  
Once basic gameplay is implemented, I intend to develop a small GUI using Flask 
and deploy it on AWS/GCP/Azure to get more familiar with those tools.  
Depending on time and motivation, I'd like to get into automatic gameplay.


Sounds a bit boring right ? What if I said it with little images and bullet points ?
